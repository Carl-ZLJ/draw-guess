## TODO

- [x] Instead of redrawing everything on the canvas when emphsis a sample,
use a transparency canvas to only redraw the sample.

- [ ] Long list rendering perf

- [ ] Performance when wheeling the canvas. Consider using `OffsetScreenCanvas`

- [ ] When moving the samples, using an Image instead of redraw everything, but don't forget to update the data.

- [ ] Calculate the sample's width and height in a more reasonable way.

- [ ] Calculate a probability for the classification to be correct, based on the 
number of neighbors of the predicted class.

- [ ] Best K value
